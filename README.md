On rasterized layers  

On the meshes of a Perlin terrain 

On the sheen of my screen 

I write your name.  

&nbsp;

On every page I browse  

On the scripts I compose

On Sublime Text's text

I write your name.

&nbsp;

 
On "float-left", over the bridge  

On "text-align:center"'s neutrality  

On "inline-block" within the ranks

I write your name.

&nbsp;
 
On the bundles I install  

On the seeds I rake  

and each snippet I wreck  

I write your name.

&nbsp;

On invariable classes 

On variables and empty arrays  

And on "Absolute positioning"  

I write your name.

&nbsp;

On restricted access  

On the passwords I encrypt  

On every change I commit  

I write your name.

&nbsp;
 
On abstraction without emojis  

On Tinder's naked solitude  

On programmed obsolescence  

I write your name.

&nbsp;
 
And by the power of one word  

I start my life over  

I was born to know you  

To name you

&nbsp;
 
Liberty.
