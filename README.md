On rasterized layers  

On the meshes of a Perlin terrain 

On the sheen of my screen 

I write your name.  

&nbsp;

On every pages I browse
On the scripts I compose
On Sublime text's text
I write your name.
 
On "float-left", over the bridge
On "text-align:center"'s neutrality
On "inline-block" property
I write your name.
 
On the bundles I install
On the seeds I rake
and each snippet I wreck
I write your name.

On immutable class system
On variables and empty arrays
And on "Absolute positioning"
I write your name.

On restricted access
On the passwords I encrypt
On every changes I commit
I write your name.
 
On abstraction without emojis
On Tinder's naked solitude
On programmed obsolescence
I write your name.
 
And by the power of one word
I start my life over
I was born to know you
To name you.
 
Liberty.
 
Paul Ã‰luard (Recueils Clandestins, 1943).
